list the backup record:
/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bplist -C client_hostname -t 4 -l  -R -s 10/01/2019 00:00:00 -e 10/03/2019 /
EXIT STATUS 25: cannot connect on socket

1. check the bp.conf

2. Check the connection between Client and Master

3. Check the Cert problem
[root@client netbackup]# /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -displayCACertDetail -server master-bck

CA Certificate received successfully from server master-bck.

         Subject Name : /CN=nbatd/OU=root@master/O=vx

CA Certificate State : Not Trusted

[root@client netbackup]# /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -getCACertificate -server master-bck

The SHA1 fingerprint of root certificate is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.
Are you sure you want to continue using this certificate ? (y/n): y
The validation of root certificate fingerprint is successful.
CA certificate stored successfully from server master-bck.

Check the client cert
It seems the client doesnâ€™t have the cert.
Deploy the Cert with new token.

[root@client netbackup]# /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -hostselfcheck  -server master-bck
Unable to read CRL for server = master-bck, error = 5949.
Unable to read certificate.
EXIT STATUS 5949: Certificate does not exist.

[root@client netbackup]# /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -getCertificate -host client-bck -server master-bck -token XXXXXXXXXXXX
Host certificate and certificate revocation list received successfully from server master-bck.

[root@client netbackup]# /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -hostselfcheck -server master-bck
Certificate is not revoked.

4. delete the webservice cache
To prevent the connection failures or delays, perform the following steps on the client host:

1) Delete the web service tunnel cache file.
Unix: /usr/openv/netbackup/websvctunnels.cache
Windows: <InstallPath>\NetBackup\websvctunnels.cache

2) Clear the host cache.
bpclntcmd -clear_host_cache
